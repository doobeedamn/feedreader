# Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Feedreader

The purpose of this project is to create a suite of tests using the Jasmine javascript testing framework. These suite of tests will test the functionality of an existing web page application.


## Installation
------------
Jasmine code and installation instructions can be found at github.com
https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine


## Running the code
----------------
The tests are all written in the feedreader.js file which resides in the jasmine/spec/ folder.

The results of the tests can be seen by simply opening the index.html file on a browser.

Jasmine will append to the end of the page a report of how each of the tests performed.If one or more of the tests fail the overall color of the page will be red. Under the Jasmine logo there will be a sequence of dots representing the given tests. Any tests that passed are green in color and those that failed are red in color. This is followed by error tracing information pointing to the location of the specific error or errors.
